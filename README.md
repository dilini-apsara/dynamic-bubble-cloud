#  Interactive Typing App with Bouncing Bubbles

## Description

This app is a creative and engaging experience that combines a dynamic typing area with interactive bubbles. As you type within the designated area, a cursor blinks, and colorful bubbles move around the screen. When the cursor hovers over a small bubble, a larger bubble appears around the cursor, blinking its shadow. The small bubble then bounces in the opposite direction, adding a playful touch to the typing experience.
